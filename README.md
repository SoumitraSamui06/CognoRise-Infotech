This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to classify the sentiment expressed in the reviews using machine learning models.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
## Models Used
The project uses the following machine learning models for sentiment analysis:
1. Naive Bayes  
2. Random Forest  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors  
4. XGBoost  
5. Logistic Regression  
6. Decision Tree
## Results
The project provides a comparison of the performance of each model. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
